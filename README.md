Terminal Invaders
===

A terminal-based Space Invaders clone, written in Python, for teaching basic Python.

The game is written to show students what they can do, knowing only:
- strings and numbers
- lists
- functions
- if tests
- while loops

This version of the game should not depend on:
- classes
- dictionaries

If this game is fun for students, it might be worth writing a version that uses dictionaries, and a version that uses classes.

Running Terminal Invaders
===
Terminal Invaders uses the package `getch` to get keypresses as they happen, without waiting for the player to press the Enter key. On Ubuntu 12.04, this should get you up and running:

    pip install getch
    git clone http://github.com/ehmatthes/terminal_invaders
    python terminal_invaders.py

Have fun, and I'm always happy to hear feedback:
